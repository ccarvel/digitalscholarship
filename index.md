# RECOGNIZING AND EXTRACTING HANDWRITTEN TEXT USING PYTHON AND HANDPRINT
This tutorial will help you use Microsoft's Azure and/or Google's Cloud Platform (GCP) to recognize and extract handwritten text from image or PDF files.
This tutorial requires the command line and is macOS-centric. 
Linux-based systems will likely mirror the steps here--some of the commands or steps will be similar though not identical. 
Windows 10 can also execute these workflows but offers 3 routes to running Python--by using either of two Windows-based Python environments, or, by installing a Linux subsystem for Windows. For Windows 10 users, we suggest the use of a [Linux subsystem installation](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).

The goals for this tutorial are:
* 0.  Set up the **Homebrew package manager** to add **Python 3** and **PIP 3** to your command line using **pyenv**;
* 1a. Set up **Microsoft Azure Cloud** for text recognition and extraction;
* 1b. Set up **Google Cloud Platform** for text recognition and extraction;
* 2.  Set up your shell **(PATH)** for connecting to Azure and/or GCP for text recognition and extraction;
* 3.  Installing and running a Python module **(handprint)** that interacts with Azure and/or GCP and does the work of using computer vision to analyze images or PDFs containing unrecognized written material to return editable text files. 

## 0. INSTALL HOMEBREW, PYTHON, AND PIP
* Open your macOS Terminal with Spotlight by entering 
```âŒ˜ + spacebar``` and typing 
```Terminal```
to launch the Terminal command line interface
Take note of which shell your OS is using by typing:
```echo "$SHELL"```
In most cases you'll receive a response of either:
```/bin/zsh```
or 
```/bin/bash```
This tells us what PATH file to edit to ensure everything runs smoothly.


```xcode-select --install
